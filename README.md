# Video-Analytics-Based-Promotion-and-Marketing-through-Customer-Diversity
With the increase of global brands and outlets, Pakistanâ€™s retail sector at present witnessing an
impressive growth. The local retailers are expanding their boundaries to compete with their larger
foreign competitors. Marketing is a tricky task to do, even once you've worked out your key target
audience you need to consider the diversity within that group. Few brands only appeal to one
specific demographic of people; one age group or gender, most companies will need to appeal to
a much wider variety.

Once we are aware of marketing strategies that identify the target audience for our products, we
can use equally targeted advertising to deliver the right loyalty and promotional messages to the
right users. To provide marketers complete record of their users we are devising a solution which
identify the gender and age group of consumers.
